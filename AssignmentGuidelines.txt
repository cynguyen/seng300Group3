	OVERVIEW:
		YOUR TEAM ARE TO USE ANALYSIS TOOL FOR FINDING JAVA TYPE DECLARATIONS AND REFERENCES, 
		IN ORDER TO ANALYZE TRENDS ACROSS A SET OF OPEN-SOURCE SYSTEMS.
		
	REQUIREMENTS/NEED TO BE SUBMITTED:
		1. ZIP FILE CONTAINING YOUR EXPORTED ECLIPSE PROJECT:
			1. 100 JAVA-BASED OPEN SOURCE SYSTEMS HOSTED ON GITHUB
			2. SOURCE CODE FOR ANALYSIS TOOL 
			3. TEST SUITES
		2. WRITTEN DOCUMENT (5-7 PAGES IN LENGTH, PLUS THE COVER PAGE)
			EXPLAINING THE FOLLOWING:
				1. HOW DID YOU SELECT THE 100 SYSTEMS?
				
				2. HOW OFTEN ARE NESTED TYPES DECLARED?
				3. HOW OFTEN ARE LOCAL TYPES DECLARED?
				4. HOW OFTEN ARE ANONYMOUS TYPES DECLARED?
				5. hOW OFTEN ARE NESTED, LOCAL, AND ANONYMOUS TYPES USED, COMPARED TO OTHER KINDS OF TYPES?
				6. DO YOU SEE BIG DIFFERENCES IN THESE VALUES IN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS?
					SPECULATE ABOUT WHY OR WHY NO?
				
				7. HOW DID YOU COLLECT, RECORD, AND ANALYZE THE DATA IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS?
				8. HOW MANY BUGS DID YOU FIND IN YOUR ANALYSIS TOOL?
					DID YOU RERUN EARLIER SYSTEMS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU STILL OBTAINED THE SAME DATA?
				9. ARE THE RESULTS CORRECT? 
					HOW CAN WE KNOW?
				10. HOW WILL THE RESULTS GENERALIZE TO OTHER JAVA SYSTEMS, AND NON-JAVA SYSTEMS?
				11. ARE NESTED, LOCAL, AND ANONYMOUS TYPES WORTHWHILE, CONSIDERING HOW THEY ARE USED IN PRACTICE AND 
					THE EXTRA COMPLICATIONS THAT THEY CAUSE (FOR DEVELOPERS? FOR ANALYZERS?)?
		
			MUST ALSO ADDRESS ONE ADDITIONAL QUESTION FROM THE FOLLOWING LIST:
				1. How stable are nested, local, and anonymous types, particularly compared to other types?  
					Meaning: How much/how often do they change across versions of the same system?)  
					Explain how you would realistically change your analysis tool and the actual analysis procedure in order 
					to answer this question.
				
				OR 
				
				
				2. How buggy are nested, local, and anonymous types, particularly compared to other types?  
				Explain how you would realistically change your analysis tool and the actual analysis procedure in order 
				to answer this question.
				
				
		3. GIT LOG
		4. RAW DATA 
			(E.G., IN A SPREADSHEET)
